## Understanding Miles per Gallon

Within this presentation I will present a plot that highlights the relationship between various factors and the amount of miles per gallon a car can run. The following variables will be used:

- Weight --> can be read as wt from the figure
- The number of cylinders --> the colours of the dots
- Horsepower --> the size of the dots

## Visualization

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
